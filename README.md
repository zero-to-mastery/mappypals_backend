# MAPPYPALS :earth_africa:
__An app that keeps track of your friends by putting them on a map__

MappyPals is a collaboration project managed by a small group of dedicated fellow students. Building an application to provide users a platform to keep track of which countries their friends and family are in, to make meeting up an easier task.

MappyPals is being built upon the MERN stack, with the intention of releasing and maintaining the project in the real world based upon user suggestions and feedback. Therefor providing an awesome opportunity not only the ability to expand on and learn new skills, but also a project you can include on your resume and show off to friends, family and potential employers.

# Preface
- __Background__: I’d like to travel to different countries but i’m unable to remember all the friends I have in those countries. 
- __Problem Context__: It is difficult to remember all the friends you have across the globe and that could slow down your travel plan.
- __Solution__: A web app that’ll allow you to add your friend and their detail, which will be displayed on the map. This would help in locating your friends in a specific country in which reaching out to them to host you would be much easier.

## User Scenarios
### User Sign Up/ Login
* __User A__ is a student who stumbled upon MappyPals while reading through a travel blog about the best apps for meeting travellers, he think it’ll be a useful app for him to plan his next travel so he sings up to enjoy the full features MappyPals has to offer. 
* __User B__ is a Digital Nomad who found out about MappyPals through our launch on ProductHunt, he thought it was an interesting app so as a tech junkie, he quickly signed up to test the app by adding some friends. Few months after, he’s about to travel to Germany where few of his friends are, he quickly loads the app and logs in to contact his friends in Germany. 
### Map Functionalities
#### Browser Permission
* Upon logging in for the first time, the browser prompts a user to grant MappyPals the permission to use their location
    * If YES, the map loads the user's current location
    * If No, the map loads its default location (San Francisco)
#### Map interaction
* __User A__ is able interact with the Map by dragging it around and zooming in on a specific location.  
#### Pin Friend to Map
* When a user clicks/taps on the map, they a prompted with a form to add their friends details. 
* When they click save, the friend is pinned to the point that specifically clicked on the map 
* When a user hovers on a pinned friend, a Pop up emerges showing that specific person’s details 
* When a user clicks on a pinned friend, they are directed to the friends profile where they’ll be able so see more details and possible drop them a message 	
#### Friend Invitation Flow

### User Changes Location 
* __user A__ moved from England to Ireland, so when he launches MappyPals, the application detects his current location and automatically updates it in database. All his pinned friends then gets a notification about the User A’s change of location and when his friend check their map, he’s no longer pinned on England, he’s now automatically pinned on Ireland. 
*__User A__'s friends in Ireland and people with the same interests as him that live in Ireland then gets notified that he’s in the country.  
### Search / Filter
* __User B__ has now arrived safely in Germany so when he launches MappyPals, the current map position is Germany, but he then remembered that he has a friend in Brazil which he’d like to add to the map. He’s doesn’t want to go through the hassle of finding Brazil by dragging the map around endlessly, so he quickly searches for Brazil on the search bar which then repositioned the Map to Brazil. He’s now able to quickly add his friends whenever he remembers their location. Brazil might be User B’s next destination, who knows?
### User Adds Travel Plan
